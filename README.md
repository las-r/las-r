I'm las_r and I make Stuff™, sometimes.

I typically program in Python but I have experience in other language like Lua and Ruby along with other fields like web development. I can also work with embedded systems such as microcontrollers.

### Things I've Made
- Pupil, an interpreted programming language.
- GREED, an esolang.
- CHIP-8 Python, a full port of the CHIP-8 programming language to Python.
- Various remakes of games in Python.
- and More™!
