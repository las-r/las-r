Hi! I'm las_r and I come stuff, sometimes.

I typically program in Python or JavaScript but I have experience in other languages like Lua and Ruby. I can also work on embedded systems such as microcontrollers.

The stuff I make isn't really high quality, nor is it impressive. Perhaps one day I'll start making useful stuff.

### Things I've Made
- [Enn](https://github.com/las-r/enn), a NAND-based esolang with only 4 commands.
- [Hurdatle](https://github.com/las-r/hurdatle), a hurricane season guessing game.
- [Eternle](https://github.com/las-r/eternle), a Roblox tower obby guessing game.
- [Snake Pygame](https://github.com/las-r/snake-pygame), an extensively customizable Snake remake.
- [CHIP-8 Python](https://github.com/las-r/chip-8-python), an interpreter of the CHIP-8 programming language to Python.
- [Matrix Anim](https://github.com/las-r/matrix-anim), a very lightweight and minimal MicroPython library for LED matrix displays.
- and [more](https://github.com/las-r?tab=repositories).
